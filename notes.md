## Security Questions
- How common are install scripts? {M}
- What do install scripts usually do? {M}
- CVEs and CVSSs for packages {M, A}



## Typing (TS, etc.) Questions
- How are typed packages published to NPM? {M, T}
- How many packages (JS?) typecheck with `tsc`? {M, T}
- Measure something about migrations of packages from untyped to typed {M, T}


## Characteristics of code updates
- Note: these things should be conditional on non-autogenerated code?
- What files get changed?  {M, T}
- Are there updates where the only difference is dependency / metadata changes?  {M, T}
- How often do updates: change actual executable code? Just change types? Just add only new code?  {M, T}
- And does that match with semver?  {M, T}


## Code property questions
- How many use `eval`? Past / present  {M, T}
- Replication of 2011 article. The one where they scrape JS from top websites and look for `eval`, etc. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22655-7_4   {M, T}
- How commonly does autogenerated code occur? {M, T}
- How often are binaries included in packages? Or other types of weird things (GIFs)? {M, T}
- Changes to use of language features? {M, T, R?}
    + require vs. import
    + async/await
    + arrow functions
    + classes
    + etc.


## How do dependencies change over time?
- How common are: changing version constraints vs. adding new packages vs. deleting packages  {M}
- After an update is published, how quickly do downstream packages update to receive it?  {M}
- How are dependencies updated to patch vulnerabilities in dependencies?  {M, A}


## Ranking of packages
- Which packages are "important" to the ecosystem? (see trivial packages paper, "technical plus factor")   {M, D?}




## Questions that we harvest from prior work
- ...




# Data that we have

## Metadata {M}
- 2.6 million packages
- 28 million package-version pairs, each one has a url to the repo {R}

## Tarballs {T}
- 28 million tarballs, one for each p-v pair

## GH Advisors (could scrape) {A}
- We could scrape the GH advisory database. It's pretty easy to do.

## Download metrics {D}
- We have download metrics scraped for all packages.

## Repos {R}
- We have repos linked for all package-version pairs

## A Measurement Study of Google Play - https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2591971.2592003

- They don't have historical data like we do, they only have data since when they started mining
- They actually reverse engineered the API by disassembling Google Play
- Mined number of free apps vs paid apps over a time span
  - answers: how does the free/paid app ratio change between date x and y?
- Categorized apps, showed ratio of free/paid for each category (one app can belong to only 1 category)
- Showed how star-ratings change based on the app being free/paid and the amount of downloads the app has
- Showed how the number of downloads of an app affects the probability of the app depending on certain libraries (more downloads, more native lib prob)
  - By checking which libraries it depends on, they inferred things like:
    - Which advertisement platform they used (if any)
    - Which social platform is the app connected to (if any)
    - ...
- They showed the amount of duplicate apps in the google play store
- They went through the source code of each app and looked for leaking API secret keys, and found quite a few

## The Evolution of Type Annotations in Python: An Empirical Study - https://www.software-lab.org/publications/fse2022_type_study.pdf

- They use github to mine repos
- They analyzed how many projects are using type annotations in Python over time
- Showed how many people are using which kind of annotation (function argument, return and variable annotations)
- Showed how much of these annotations exist in the projects
  - do they fully annotate everything as if python was a statically typed language?
  - do they occasionally type things here and there?
  - did they have no types before, but then decided to type annotate everything after?
- Out of all the commits in these projects, how many commits where type-related?
- Showed positive relation between type errors in a project and the number of type annotations in the project.
  - (remember: you can ignore type errors in python)


## https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04638.pdf

- they mined 169,964 npm packages


## https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9387131

- this one seems to only analyze 15,000 packages
- but has a lot of information on them
